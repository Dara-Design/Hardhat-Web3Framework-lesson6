https://hardhat.org/  Ethereum development environment for professionals

An entry point for Hardhat is hardhat.congif.js

HARDHAT installation:

npm init | 
npm add --dev hardhat |
npx hardhat  |
npx Hardhat compile // to compile --> we get artifacts and cache folder 

artifacts folder contains all the information about our compiled code



HardHat Network -it has its own built in network, which means whenever we run a script/task in Hardhat, and do not specify a network, we deploy to a fake HardHat network, and we DO NOT NEED TO DEFINE RPC_URL AND A PRIVATE KEY -this is one of the major advantages of working with Hardhat

-IN ANY SCRIPT WE RUN, WE CAN EXPLICITLY CHOOSE THE NETWORK:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network hardhat
-we can shift between networks
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia



-RUNNING TESTS IS CRITICAL FOR CONTRACT DEVELOPMENT-

 https://rekt.news/    //previous hacking warnings

 Hardhat testing works with mocha framework -   mochajs.org

 npx hardhat test //to run test in terminal
 npx hardhat test -grep  this-is-filter-keyword //if we want to  filter a certain test 

 Hardhat-gas-reporter //extension
 npm install hardhat-gas-reporter  --dev
 gas-reporter  runs automatically when  we run our tests
 Coinmarketcap  api ,get key //If we want to deploy to polygon network, we use  token   MATIC, Token for Ethereum je ETH

Solidity-coverage plugin
-it goes through all of our tests and sees exactly how many lines of code in our contract is  covered  --it advises you to add some test for parts of code where it is missing

Npm install â€“dev solidity-coverage

Npx run coverage    //-we get coverage.json - in .gitignore
